# Catch-IT-Project
Catch-IT is currently a work in progress game that is designed and created by me. Mainly made to practice a new coding language but to also get a hint of what it is like creating an application for iOS. Coding langauge used for this project was C#. I try and work on the project as often as I can. 

Date Project was Started: Nov 2019.
