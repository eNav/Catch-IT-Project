# Catch-IT-Project
Catch-IT is currently a work in progress game that is designed and created by me. Mainly made to practice a new coding language but to also get a hint of what it is like creating an application for iOS. The coding language used for this project was C#. I try and work on the project as often as I can. The name is still currently in the air but this is a placeholder until I finalize the project. 

Date Project was Started: Nov 2019.

How does Catch-IT work?
You are a catcher on the bottom of the screen and you move your finger to the right/left to move it. The concept of the game is to catch randomized falling balls from the top of the screen. The more balls that are caught, the faster the balls will drop and the score will increase.
